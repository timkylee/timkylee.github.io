== About Me
I am an EECS Ph.D. student at UC Berkeley majoring in communications and networking. Prior to joining Berkeley, I received a bachelor's degree in Electrical Engineering from National Taiwan University (NTU) in my hometown, Taiwan. My research interest lies in the intersection of information theory, statistics, and machine learning.
